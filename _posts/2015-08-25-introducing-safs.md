title: Software Automation Framework Support
---

Welcome to the SAFSDEV project!    See [What's New](http://safsdev.github.io/Default.htm), including our latest releases for:

- [SeleniumPlus Release](https://github.com/SAFSDEV/SeleniumPlus-Plugin/releases) for Advanced HTML5/SAPUI5 testing with SAFS/Selenium RemoteWebDriver!
- [SAFS Win Release](https://github.com/SAFSDEV/Core/releases) --- includes the full breadth of SAFS support on Windows!
- [Robotium Remote Control Release](https://sourceforge.net/projects/safsdev/files/Robotium%20RemoteControl/) for Android testing with Robotium 5.2.1! (no SAFS)
- [SAFS Mac Release](https://sourceforge.net/projects/safsdev/files/SAFS%20Mac/) for Apple iOS testing!

Our focus is on implementing tools and frameworks for strategic, long-term success in functional test automation.  To that end we work on `keyword-driven` engines, also sometimes called `data-driven` engines.  What we are dealing with, actually, are tools and full implementations of testing frameworks for `action-based testing` or "the action word approach" for functional test automation.  Read more about the benefits of keyword-driven testing in the [Test Automation Frameworks Whitepaper](http://safsdev.github.io/FRAMESDataDrivenTestAutomationFrameworks.htm).

### Built on Poole

Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). Poole, and every theme built on it (like Lanyon here) includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### Lanyon features

In addition to the features of Poole, Lanyon adds the following:

* Toggleable sliding sidebar (built with only CSS) via **â˜°** link in top corner
* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#themes), available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#readme) to learn more.

### Browser support

Lanyon is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Lanyon is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
